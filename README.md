# Sloth Foundation

A responsive website built with HTML and CSS as an assignment for Brainnest Frontend Training Program.

Live website: https://julianesilvac75.github.io/sloth-foundation/

The website contains three working pages so far:
- Homepage
- Donation page
- Thank you page

This was a great group work that was only possible thanks to the skills of my amazing teammates:
[Sorrell](https://github.com/srjam89), [Fernando](https://github.com/ferchoeth) and [Victor](https://github.com/BlckTitan)
